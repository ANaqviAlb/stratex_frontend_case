# stratex_frontend_case

  1. For the assignment I spent 2 hours approx, if given more time I would have worked on the UI/UX more. 
     Further Improvement :
      1. sorting the table when new user is added.
      2. adding a modal binding to ask user if he wants to delete the user.
      3. If search is applied adding a new user should also go through the search keyword.
      4. Validation through form while adding users.
  
  2. Focus areas:
      1. Code should be easy to understand.
      2. Good Naming conventions shall be used.
      3. UX shall remain intact.
      4. Readablitiy of code.
